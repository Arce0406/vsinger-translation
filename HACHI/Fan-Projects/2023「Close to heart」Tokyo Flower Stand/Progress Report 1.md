*Please note that based on the calculation results of different banks, the actual amount is the highest point.

## Use of funds

Regarding the use of funds, all funds for this project are expected to be used for Flower Stand, decorative panels, printing fees, and shipping costs.
If any unexpected situations arise that result in exceeding the aforementioned purposes, we will report it here and on other subsequent promotional SNS platforms.
Some exceptions that are currently being considered are as follows:

- Insufficient betting amount: The organizer will absorb the remaining costs.
- Excessive betting amount: If the amount is excessive and cannot be fully utilized on a single Flower Stand, we will consider giving multiple Flower Stands as gifts, giving additional gifts to HACHI, or leaving the funds for the performances in Taiwan.

*Note: It is not yet known whether Taiwanese performances allow audiences to give away Flower Stands.
